; this is a basic text walking sim, related to the Lycosurian Mysteries,
; and meant to be played via telnet/ssh

; it was planned to be a promotional tie in with the album release, but
; the decision was made to cancel, given the basis of the project was a
; deprecated python bbs daemon package, not to mention efforts needed to
; be focused on actually finishing the music.. 

; so here we are a couple years later, maybe listen to the music while
; playing this :^)

; when compiled and placed in /bin or similar, it is meant to be called
; as a user's login shell
